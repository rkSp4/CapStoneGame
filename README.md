## FORDA CAPSTONE THINGS
- **Classes and Objects [25%] -** ✔️

    **Factory -** Many of our object classes like `OBJ_BOOTS`, `OBJ_CHEST`, etc., use a common metho for creating object instances. The method `setup()` acts as a factory for                         creating and configuring objects.
  
    **Composite -** The `Map` class holds a collection of `Tile` objects in a grid. Each tile is independent, but they work together to complete the world map.
  
    **Prototype -** The class `Entity` uses the Prototype pattern where an instance is cloned and modified based on specific needs (such as different types of objects like                             `OBJ_BOOTS`, `OBJ_KEY`, etc.).
