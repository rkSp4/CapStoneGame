//NEEDS WORK (just AI)

Description:
In Paws and Shadows, you take on the role of a clever and agile stray cat navigating the bustling streets and rooftops of a lively urban neighborhood. Your mission? Collect shiny treasures, food scraps, and other valuable trinkets scattered around the city while avoiding the watchful eyes of patrolling humans whoâ€™d rather chase you off than let you scavenge in peace. 

Gameplay:

Exploration: Navigate through various urban environments, including parks, markets, alleys, and rooftops, to find and collect items.

Stealth Mechanics: Hide behind objects, sneak past people, and time your movements carefully to avoid detection. Humans will react differently based on their roles (e.g., shopkeepers will chase, children may try to play).

Item Collection: Gather specific items to complete levels or unlock bonus challenges. Items range from sparkling jewelry to juicy fish bones.

Objective:
Complete each level by collecting a set number of items while avoiding capture. Bonus challenges include collecting rare items or finishing a level without being spotted.

Art Style:
Vibrant, hand-drawn 2D graphics with a playful, cartoonish vibe. Dynamic day/night cycles bring the city to life, with glowing streetlights and bustling daytime activities.

Sound Design:
A mix of upbeat tunes and stealthy, suspenseful music that intensifies when humans are nearby. Sound effects include realistic meows, rustling trash, and human footsteps.

Target Audience:
Casual gamers and animal lovers of all ages looking for a fun, lighthearted challenge.
